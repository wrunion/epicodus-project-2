      <h3>Free and Affordable Resources</h3>
      <p>There's a lot of learning and networking that you can do on your own, without spending a dime! Free Code Camp, W3Schools, Treehouse, Code Academy, and Coursera all have an abundance of free and affordable resources. Yes, the certification often costs more, but most of the curriculum is available for free - and Coursera offers scholarships for most of their classes.</p>
      <p>There are also several online learning sites, such as <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, where you can purchase quality, in-depth programming courses for less than $20. That's a far cheaper way to explore a new skill! They also come with course completion certificates, so along with the new projects you'll have in your portfolio, you'll have a new certification to list on your resume!</p>
      <p>Finally, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meetup.com</a> is a great place to start networking. Over 50% of new jobs are never publicly posted, so get out there, find the tech networking groups in your area, and start shaking some hands!</p>
